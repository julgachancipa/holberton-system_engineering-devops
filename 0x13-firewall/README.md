Holberton teaches full-stack software engineering with a project-based approach.
The first part of our on-site intensive education covers the foundations of software
engineering, including low-level programming, DevOps, and high-level modern languages.

This project is part of *system engineering and devops*, where you will build web infrastructure similar to those powering tech powerhouses like LinkedIn,
Facebook, and Google. You will architect scalable, reliable, and secure systems using web
servers, load balancers, databases, firewalls, and more. You will learn to automate your job
so that you can easily manage anything from one server or hundreds of them.
